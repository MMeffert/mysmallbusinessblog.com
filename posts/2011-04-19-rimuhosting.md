RimuHosting is a dedicated and VPS ([Virtual Private Server](http://rimuhosting.com/vps-servers?r=56938501259659558034004100138771044269)) hosting company based out of New Zealand. Not only do they have servers available in New Zealand but they also have many other hosting options around the world including Dallas, New York and London. [RimuHosting](http://rimuhosting.com/?r=56938501259659558034004100138771044269) has always been known for there customer service, reliability and flexibility of hosting plans. Each of these will be discussed along with why it may be a good business decision to move to a company such as [RimuHosting](http://rimuhosting.com/?r=56938501259659558034004100138771044269) for your business hosting needs.

**Whats "Rimu"?**

To start with you may be wondering what a "Rimu" is. Rimu (Ree-moo) is a tree that is native to New Zealand.

**Customer Service**

Customer service has been what [RimuHosting](http://rimuhosting.com/?r=56938501259659558034004100138771044269) is best known for. Them use a support system in which if you have an issue you can login to there website and send them an email from your account. This email is then reviewed within a few minutes and then is assigned to a support person. The response times can very depending on the number of support tickets that they have at that time but is normally very quick. The support ticket system that they use is called [InboxHarmony](http://inboxharmony.com/). [InboxHarmony](http://inboxharmony.com/) was created by [RimuHosting](http://rimuhosting.com/?r=56938501259659558034004100138771044269) in order to make there support as efficient as possible and also gave them the ability to sort tickets based on severity and which needs to be done first. If someone submits a ticket saying that there server is down, this would be a higher priority then someone with a general question.

Customer service also means that they are willing to help you out if your not sure how to do something. One example of this is when setting up Spam Assassin for email spam filtering. With your permission they will login to your server and add Spam Assassin to your email service and test it to make sure everything is working. This is very helpful when you run into issues that you can not solve. Most of the time this service is free but for larger problems such as completely installing an email server, they may charge for that service but that rates are very competitive and they will let you know if there is going to be a charge before they start.

**Reliability**

When it comes to website hosting server up time is an important factor. Your website being down can cause customers to not revisit your website. Since I have started with [RimuHosting](http://rimuhosting.com/?r=56938501259659558034004100138771044269) about 6 months ago, I have had very minimal downtime, most of which was caused by a misconfiguration on my part. Even when the problem was with a configuration I made, [RimuHosting](http://rimuhosting.com/?r=56938501259659558034004100138771044269) was willing to assist me if needed in order to get my website back online. When it comes to network outages, [RimuHosting](http://rimuhosting.com/?r=56938501259659558034004100138771044269) offers the ability to receive emails and text messages when there is a network outage that would affect your server along with updates and when to expect the service to be back up. This helps to relieve a lot of the frustration from not knowing what is going on and when it will be fixed.

**Flexible Hosting Plans**

The goal of most websites is to grow over time. This means that at some point you will have to go through a process of migrating your site to a new server or hosting provider when you outgrow the current environment. This is not an issue with RimuHosting. At RimuHosting you have the flexibility to upgrade your memory, disk space or bandwidth with a few clicks and a server restart. This allows your site to grow and your server will grow with it. If at some point you outgrow your VPS or need the power of a dedicated server, RimuHosting has an automated system that can move your site, programs and configurations to a new server automatically. The price for upgrading memory, disk space and bandwidth is very reasonable and at times you will receive free upgrades as RimuHosting upgrades to larger servers with more memory available.

**Conclusion**

RimuHosting has high reliability and also gives you the flexibility to upgrade your server with a few clicks but the most important part is the people behind the company that are there to help when you are having issues configuring a program or you've been hacked and need to recover your important data.
