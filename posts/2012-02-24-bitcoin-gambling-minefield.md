[MineField](http://minefield.bitcoinlab.org/?r=GXn5oVUmS1XkXP3n) is a strategy/luck game that you can play with Bitcoin. You start by [visiting the site](http://minefield.bitcoinlab.org/?r=GXn5oVUmS1XkXP3n) and your login will be created and stored in the URL. This means that if you want to return to your account you need to bookmark the URL and not give it out to anyone else. Then you will be given a wallet address once you click on the balance box at the top of the page in which you can send Bitcoins to. If you don't want to deposit Bitcoins at first they have a free option which you can play also.

How the game works is you select the amount you want to bet and then use the slider under the game to choice your difficulty. The more difficult you make the game, the more you could win as the difficult has a multiplier associated with it. This can be a fun way to use your Bitcoins but could also be a way to make some good money.

The website can be found [here](http://minefield.bitcoinlab.org/?r=GXn5oVUmS1XkXP3n).
