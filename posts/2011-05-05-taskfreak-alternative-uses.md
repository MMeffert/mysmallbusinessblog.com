With the Spring term coming to an end, preperation for the Fall term is beginning. The search for a place to live was grulling but I finally found a place. Now the preperation has to begin with everything that I need to remember and everything that I need to purchase. This is were TaskFreak has again helped me. The normal use of TaskFreak is for prioritizing tasks. I have decided instead to use it for prioritizing items that I need to either purchase or find for my appartment.

### Prioritizing Items

Items depending on how esential they are can be ranked as to the imprtance of them. This can help to make purchasing decisions based on which items are higher on the list and making sure to purchase the most important items before the lower ranked items in case financial means becomes an issue. TaskFreak also allows comments to be placed on the items in order to document deals that you find on the item or styles and designs that you like. This works best if you have more people living in the place then just yourself. An example is, I am living with a roommate and if I add an item to the list, my roommate can look at the items but also make comments if you like the idea of purchasing that item but also of any deals that they find on the item.

### Purchasing Items

TaskFreak also allows you to mark off items that have been purchased. This works by marking the item as 100% done and then it will be removed from the list. This also allows your roommates to see what items are still needed and which items have been purchased. If you view the complete list of items you are able to see everything that has been purchased for the apartment and also who purchased it (if you have everyone leave a comment about who purchased each item).

Preparing for moving into a new apartment or house can be a large, daunting task but staying organized with what items you need and which items you have already purchased can help to remove some of the stress by making yourself more organized.
