Paxum is one of the major ways to get funds into the bitcoin market. Once you have money in Paxum then you can buy Bitcoin. Once you sign up for Paxum there are a few hoops you will have to jump through before you can put money into your Paxum account.

The first hoop that you will need to complete is sending proof of address to Paxum. This can be in the form of drivers license, bank statement, or electricity bill. One of these documents must be scanned in and then submitted on their online form. The tricky part is that they have a large number of requirements and if the scan isn't perfect then they won't accept it. I had this issue a few times before I finally got the document accepted.

The second hoop that you need to complete is to submit proof of identification. This can include a passport or drivers license. These documents must be scanned perfectly also in order to get them accepted. One suggestion is to make sure your documents are in the middle of the scanning area and put a colored sheet of paper on top of them so that the edges are very defined. Also make sure not to crop the scanned image even if there is a lot of blank space around the document.

Once you make it through these hoops transferring money from your credit card or bank account isn't difficult and it is a mandatory step if you are going to get money into the Bitcoin Exchange.
