The server was purchased with 5 x 1.5TB drives. 4 of which are Western Digital Green drives and the other was a Seagate 7200rpm drive. In order to make sure the Seagate drive won't cause a problem later, I decided to remove it and replace the drive with another Western Digital Green drive. I also wanted to add an additional drive in order to full out the available slots. The Dell Poweredge 2950 has 6 total harddrive slots. I ordered two new Western Digital Green drives and a few days later installed them in the server without many issues. The only issue I encountered was that I didn't make sure the server contained 6 drive trays. When I received the new drives I realized that one of the hot swap bays didn't have a harddrive tray in it so I ordered one from Amazon and it was there the next day.
