Software can be a very important aspect of getting things done at work or home but software also plays a large role in starting your own small business. Needed software will vary depending on what type of business you are starting but I am going to cover some of the paid and free options for your small business. The basic software you will need is a word processing application, email client and internet browser. All of these software categories have both free and paid options and there are advantages and disadvantages of each.

**Word Processing**
- Microsoft Office Word - Paid
- Open Office - Free
- Pages (Mac Only) - Paid

**Email Clients**
- Microsoft Outlook - Paid
- Thunderbird - Free
- Apple Mail (Mac Only) - Pre-Installed

**Internet Browser**
- Internet Explorer - Pre-Installed
- Google Chrome - Free
- Mozilla FIrefox - Free
- Apple Safari - Free

Depending on your business you are going to need more software then just the above categories. If you are planning to do graphic design you are going to need a graphics design program and just as there were free and paid options for the above products, there are free and paid options for the more advanced programs that you will need. These more advanced programs are something I might go into in an upcoming series.
