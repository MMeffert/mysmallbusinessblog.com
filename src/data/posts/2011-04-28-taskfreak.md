Keeping my business organized and making sure not to forget customer requested updates or billing issues has always been a problem. I started using a notepad and pen but it was never along with me when I needed it. Then I started using my to make notes for myself. This worked well for somethings but it was impossible to try to prioritize tasks and also remind myself of any due dates associated with the tasks. After all the hassle I decided that I need a web application to keep track of my tasks. This is when I came across a program called [TaskFreak!](http://www.taskfreak.com/) After looking at the [TaskFreak!](http://www.taskfreak.com/) website I decided that it had all the features and functions that I was looking for. The features I was looking for where:

- **Web Based** - By having the task management system web based, it is able to be accessed from any location where there is an internet connection. This means that you always have your tasks with you and can add a task anytime it comes to mind.
- **Uses PHP and Mysql** - The biggest reason that this was a criteria is because both of these are already installed on the server and I didn't want to bog the server down with any other languages that would only be used for task management.
- **Ability to Prioritize Tasks** - Prioritization of tasks allows the ability to specify what tasks need to be done as soon as possible but also the tasks that can be done later on when time permits. This is important because I wanted the ability to enter project ideas that I did not have the time to complete now but might in the future.
- **Fast Navigation** - The purpose of this task management system for me was to have the ability to enter tasks that I needed to remember at anytime from any location. The fast navigation will allow me to enter the task and supporting information without wasting a lot of time with complicated menus or slow load times.
- **User Login** - This requirement has to do with security. Some of the tasks that I may be entering will have to do with clients information which I do not want to be available to the world. This also allows me to give access to specific people if they need to have access to tasks.
- **Price** - Since this is going to be used for personal use I wanted the price to be as cheap as possible or free.

## Installation

Installation was no more difficult then installing any other PHP/Mysql application. The process involved:

- Download files from [TaskFreak!](http://www.taskfreak.com/)
- Unzip and Upload to server
- Create Mysql database
- Navigate to [TaskFreak!](http://www.taskfreak.com/) install page
